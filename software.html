							<p>Intralattice is a plugin for Grasshopper used to generate solid lattice structures within a 3D design space. It was developed as an extensible, open-source alternative to current commercial solutions. As an ongoing project developed at McGill’s Additive Design & Manufacturing Laboratory (ADML), it has been a valuable research tool, serving as a platform for breakthroughs in multi-scale design and optimization. By giving you full access to the source, we hope to collectively explore lattice design at a deeper level, and consequently, engineer better products.</p>

							<p>The rise of additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) has allowed engineers to integrate new orders of complexity into their designs. In that regard, this software generates lattice structures as a means to:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Reduce volume/weight while maintaining structural integrity.</li>
								<li>Increase surface area as a means of maximizing heat transfer.</li>
								<li>Generate porosity in bone scaffolds and implants.</li>
								<li>Serve as a platform for structural optimization..</li>
							</ul>
